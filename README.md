Hi, I'm Jamie.

After completing a couple of PhDs (Chemistry, and then some years later Physics) I'm now focussed on Data Science and Software Engineering, such as MERN stack development.

If you play guitar and/or are interested in seeing some of my work, the beta version of my fretboard visualizer is here: https://scale-and-arpeggio-visualizer.herokuapp.com/.
